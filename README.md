# Project1

Person A = Ahmed Ali
Person B = Bavly Remon
Person C = Omar Elfouly

## Distribution plan:

### Part (A) split three way:

Person Ahmed will complete 1 and 2
Person Bavly will complete 3
Person Omar will complete 4 and 5

### Part (B), (C), (D) will be evenly split across members

## Plan so far:

- [x] Confirm Distrubition with Professor
- [x] Decide on data structure(s)
- [x] Decide on function headers i.e. input and output
- [x] Plan basic algorithm flow
- [x] Person A, B, C, begin programming
- [x] Test cases

## Program Design
### Part 1:
Takes input validates SoP:
- latin letters a to z
- if there are no brackets then it is SoP
- Unclosed bracket is an automatic fail
- Operator at start or finish is a fail
- Cannot be (ab)' or (a+b)' i.e. no multi input not operations or not that acts on a sum
- any ( SUM ) must be preceded and followed by a "+" or nothing at all 
- we will consider " AA+AA' " to be valid sop
- must be products with only sums between them
- must return a list or vector of the variables in the input for other functions to use

Input: User input
Output: Clean input

### Part 2:
Input: clean user input
Output: Vector of min terms (x = {1,5,9}), and string of variables ("ACF")

### Part 3:
Input: Vector of min terms (x = {1,5,9}), and string of variables ("ACF")
Output: map where key is the PI and the data is a vector of bool values such that a True in position x means this PI covers minterm x

#### Functions used
The function uses a structure called implicant that stores the minterms covered by the implicant,
the implicant itself, and whether or not it is combined.

The program also defines several helper functions, including count_ones which counts the number of ones in a binary number, 
differ_by_one which checks if two binary numbers differ by exactly one bit, 
and combinestring which combines two binary strings into a new string where '-' is used to represent differing bits.

The to_binary_string function converts a decimal number into a binary string and pads it with leading zeroes to reach a specified length.

The generate_column function generates a column of prime implicants from a table of minterms or implicants.
It takes in a vector of vectors of implicants, 
a vector of characters representing the variables in the function, and a string to know whether to print the output or not.

The split1 function is a string splitting function that splits .

The printVector function takes in a vector of vectors of implicants and an integer count, and prints out the implicants with their associated minterms and whether or not they are prime.

#### Design choices and changes

- Added the implicant struct instead of only using a string for the implicant to be able to store more data about the implicant 
(used struct instead of pair)

-decided to keep track of minterms combined to know the minterms covered by an implicant instead of using the implicant itself and some recursive function (reason why struct was implemented )

-Used an Unordered set instead of a vector to keep track of repeated combined implicants as it is O(1) search

-Used a do while loop instead of for loop to stop whe no more implicants can be combined 

-added extra parameter in the function to add the option to print or not



### Part 4 and 5:
Input:map where key is the PI and the data is a vector of int values to represent the covers of a minterm
Output: Solved SOP

## Testing:
### Test 1:
3 variable input, with f = 0. The test input is: aa'+bb'+cc', which is evaluated to 0.

### Test 2:
3 variable input, with f = 1. The test input is a'+a+b+c, which is evaluated to 1.

### Test 3:
Demonstrating variables repeated multiple times in the same term: aaaa+b'b'b', which evaluates to a + b'.

### Test 4:
Demonstarting processing of dominance: a'b'c'd'+a'bc'd'+a'bc'd+a'bcd'+a'bcd+ab'c'd'+ab'c'd+ab'cd'+abc'd+abcd.

### Test 5:
Demonstrating how multiple negations and multiple additions are simplified. a’’b ++ c becomes ab + c.

### Test 6:
Demonstrating an inavlid PoS term, which shows bracket handling. ((abbbc)(ac+d)) would be invalid since we are multiplying a sum.

### Test 7:
Demonstrating using multiple negations on the same term, along with handling brackets. (((abbbc’’’’’))+cdd) becomes abc’ + cd

### Test 8:
Demonstrating a multiple variable negation, which would be invalid. This also includes bracket handling. (a+b)' would be invalid.

### Test 9:
Demonstrating how the program identifies lowercase and uppercase variables to be identical. ac + Ac would be ac + ad

### Test 10:
A final all encompassing input, which contains multiple nested brackets, repeated variables in the same term, multile negations, and multiple additions, all at once. ((((abcd’’’’ef’’’ghij)) + ghi’’’) ++++ abbbbc) would be evaluated as abcdef’ghij + ghi’ + abc.
